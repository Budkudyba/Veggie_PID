# Veggie_PID
Simple code to automate a low pressure filter system for waste vegetable oil (WVO) used to power diesel vehicles

The project uses an arduino nano with an attached pressure sensor and a small oled screen.

The output is to a mosfet which drives a bildge pump (boat) for pumping oil
and
a ssr (solid state relay) which drives a water heater element

The sock (filter) is from mcmaster. part number: 5162K117 (5 micron)
Mcmaster does not sell a 8in adapter, so one was 3d printed out of ASA
The bag adaptor flange is 1 1/4" NTP
